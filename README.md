Task 2: Comparison Operators
1-Two variables, a and b, are declared with numerical values.

2-Comparison operators are used to compare the values of a and b:

    a > b: true if a is greater than b.

    a < b: true if a is less than b. 

    a >= b: true if a is greater than or equal to b.

    a <= b: true if a is less than or equal to b.

    a == b: true if a is equal to b (checks value only).

    a != b: true if a is not equal to b.

3-The results of each comparison are logged to the console.
